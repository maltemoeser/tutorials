<p>This tutorial describes how to create and access Web services from .NET 4.0. Visual Studio 2010 is required.</p>

</ol>
<h2><a id="create" name="create"></a>A. Creating a WCF Web Service Application</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new "WCF Service Application" project ("Visual C# &gt; WCF").
  <ul>
    <li>With this project type, the WCF service will be deployed on a web server as a web service. The wizard creates some sample files demonstrating the general structure of a WCF service.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In order to start from scratch, delete the following generated files from the project: <small><tt>IService1.cs</tt></small> and <small><tt>Service1.svc</tt></small>. You can also delete the special Debug and Release configuration files which can be found under the Web.config node (do not delete Web.config itself).</li>
  <li>Adding a service to the application requires the following artifacts:<ol>
    <li>A service contract in the form of an interface annotated with <small><tt>[ServiceContract]</tt></small> whose methods are annotated with <small><tt>[OperationContract]</tt></small>.</li>
    <li>A class implementing this interface.</li>
    <li>Open the file Web.config and locate the XML node serviceHostingEnvironment (child of system.serviceModel). Add a child node serviceActivations under this node. For each service, a child node under serviceActivations like the following is required: <small><tt>&lt;add service="#1" relativeAddress="#2"/&gt;</tt></small><br /> Replace #1 with the namespace qualified name of the implementation class. Replace #2 with a name ending with ".svc". The service will be accessible under the address http://localhost:XXXX/#2.svc (append ?wsdl to retrieve the WSDL).<br /> Instead of step 3, you can also use a .svc-file (see the output of the wizard from step 1).</li>
  </ol></li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="access" name="access"></a>B. Accessing a Web Service from .NET</h2>
<p>The following applies regardless of the language in which the Web service is implemented.</p>
<ol>
  <li>To access a Web service from any project type, right-click on the project and select "Add Service Reference...".</li>
  <li>Enter the URL of the WSDL under "Address" and click "Go".</li>
  <li>Define a "Namespace" and click "OK".</li>
  <li>The tool will generate several classes. Use the client class to access the Web service.</li>
</ol>
